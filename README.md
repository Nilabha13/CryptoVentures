# CryptoVentures
A collection of cryptographic puzzles which might vaguely resemble an adventure through a cryptographic landscape.
Each folder here is an individual adventure.
You can attempt the adventure in any order (unless specified that you can't).
The difficulty ranges from easy to though-provoking.
Some adventures involve only Ancient Cryptography, while some may involve Modern Cryptography.
All of the final answers will be in the form of characters enclosed within crve{}, e.g., crve{encrypted_messages_can_be_cracked}.
Good Luck, and Happy CryptoVenturing!
